# Domino Factory

## Description

This game was made by 2 people during the [2023 GMTK Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2023). The theme was "Role Reversed". You can play the web version on [here](https://veack-itchio.itch.io/domino-factory).

## Theme

In this up to two players game, you play as Tetris minions Redomino and Bludomino, trying to operate the Assembler : the only machine capable of producing enough tetrominos for every game of tetris in the world. How long can you keep the players happy and provide enough tetrominos for all their games ?

We recommend playing with a friend, but all the content is enjoyable as a solo player. Also we recommend playing on **Depot** and **Depot 2** maps if you play solo. The web version might have some minor texture issues (only in menus).

## Rules

> Dear Redomino and Bludomino,  
> I'll let you take care of Tetris requests from around the world while I'm away. To help you here are the notes I use to properly manage the Domino Factory,  
> Your friend, Yellomino

Domino requests appear at the top left, you must issue them before the end of the timer. If you haven't had time to deliver a piece you lose a life, after three it's game over.  

Before assembling the domino, you must paint them in the correct colors. There are two types of paint machine, one blue and one red. Each of the two can paint several layers, for example the red paint machine will first make a light red layer then a dark red layer. Be careful if you leave the part too long, it will turn black and will be unusable in the assembler.

After painting the blocks, you must assemble together to make the domino to be delivered. In the assembler you can move the parts and turn them to make correct piece. Be careful, you cannot remove a bloc once inserted in the assembler. Similarly, **a domino coming out of the assembler cannot be painted!** You have to paint first and then assemble.

**To insert a block in the assembler you have to be on the access pad (the tile with the small arrows) and press the action key. To take the domino assembled in the assembler you must stick to this one and press the action key with empty hands.**

Finally you can deliver your tetromino. If it corresponds to a correct request, you will earn points. Otherwise you will lose some.
